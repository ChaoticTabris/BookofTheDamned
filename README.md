## Special Thanks

* Bubbles (factsubio) for creating [BubblePrints](https://github.com/factubsio/BubblePrints), which is a massive help to learning to mod this game.
* Wolfie (WittleWolfie) for creating [BlueprintCore](https://github.com/WittleWolfie/WW-Blueprint-Core) and [ModMenu](https://github.com/WittleWolfie/ModMenu) without which this mod would not exist. Also for his tutorials, which helped me learning the basics of modding WOTR, for answering my (numerous) questions and for [Character Options Plus](https://github.com/WittleWolfie/CharacterOptionsPlus) which I used as reference (maybe to a fault) on creating this mod.
* Kurufinve for helping with the several checks on the Greater Mercy Feat and for answering way too many questions.
* To the modding community on the [Owlcat Discord](https://discord.com/invite/wotr) for their support and, frankly, patience.
